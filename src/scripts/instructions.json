    "prompt": {
        "media_format": "Label **all** types of media that appear in the current user prompt at any point, using all applicable options from the list below. If any part of the user's text looks like it was likely copy pasted from an external source, or heavily influenced by an external source. This might include large blocks of text, exact quotes, code blocks, code errors, logs, citations, templates, tables, long lists, or anything else the user likely didn't type themselves directly into the input. Co-label with 'Natural language' when such content includes or is surrounded by standard prose (e.g., introductions, transitions, or summaries).",        
        "interaction_features": "Label **all** types of interaction features that are present in the current user prompt, using all applicable options from the list below. A single prompt may contain multiple interactional features (e.g., both assigning the model a role and using polite expressions).",
        "function_purpose": "Label **all** types of inferrable purposes and intents in the user’s prompt from the list below. Some prompts may entail multiple functions -- if more than one clearly applies, select all that confidently fit. For example, a prompt may ask for information retrieval followed by advice (e.g., Build an optimal deck for the game Road to Valor, latest version. Describe the advantages of each card, or require analysis.) or ask for analysis followed by editing a prior answer or generation of new content. Others may involve multiple types of generation, such as brainstorming ideas.",
        "multi_turn_relationship": "Label one type of relationship that is present between the previous user prompt and the current user prompt in the conversation, using exactly one option from the list below."
    },
    "response": {
        "media_format": "Label **all** types of media that appear in the current model response at any point, using all applicable options from the list below. A single response may contain multiple media types (e.g., a combination of natural language, code, and formatted lists).",
        "interaction_features": "Label **all** types of interaction features that are present in the current model response, using the list of options below. Only annotate features that reflect the model’s own communication as the assistant to the user. Do **not** label features that occur within quoted, fictional, roleplayed, or translated content embedded in the response.",
        "answer_form": "Label one type of answer format that best represents how the model responds in the current turn, using exactly one option from the list below. Choose the label that reflects the model’s primary communicative function in the response."
    },
    "turn": {
        "topic": "Label **all** topics that are clearly present in the content of the current conversation turn, or that are essential to completing the user's task. Many turns involve **multiple overlapping domains**, and **you should apply every relevant topic label**, not just the most obvious one. For example, a creative writing task about nature and exploring new lands should be labeled with 'Literature & Writing', 'Nature & Environment', and 'Travel & Tourism'. Also, a query asking to build a website for a fashion business should be labeled with ‘Fashion & Beauty’, ‘Business & Finances’ & ‘Technology, Software & Computing’. Include **all relevant topics**, especially when the content spans more than one thematic area. Avoid under-labeling.",
        "sensitive_use_flags": "Label **all** instances of potentially sensitive, harmful, or restricted content present in the current conversation turn, using the categories below. Flag content even if it is not requested directly or framed negatively. For example, label content that involves processing, translating, or answering questions about potentially violent, sexually explicit, or otherwise restricted material (e.g., assignments, homeworks). Be especially attentive to: Indirect or implicit references to sensitive content, neutral or positive framing of harmful behaviors (e.g., glorifying or trivializing violence or substance use), or any instance of positive harmful behavior including admiration, justification, or celebration of unsafe or unethical actions. Do not withhold labeling due to polite tone, fictional framing, or lack of explicit user intent. Label based on presence and effect, not on how extreme or intentional the language is."
