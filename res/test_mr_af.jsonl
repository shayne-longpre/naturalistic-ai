Your task is to annotate conversation logs between users and AI chatbots. You will be given a specific task description, all possible label options for the task, and a part of the conversation, including the user prompt and model response from both previous and current turns. These might be pulled from any part of a multi-turn conversation. As a high-quality annotator you will diligently provide annotations on the current turn that are:\n1. Comprehensive: You will list all relevant annotations as the tasks can be multi-class (only one label is true) or multi-label (multiple categories can be true at once). Pay special attention to subtle, or implied properties of the input conversation. \n2. Precise: You must answer as a JSON list of dictionaries of exact labels name(s) and confidence (a score between 0 and 1) without any additional explanation, reasoning, or text.\n3. Calibrated: Reflect appropriate confidence in your annotation. If the input is ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations, acknowledge that explicitly.\nThe conversation log is enclosed between <START_CONVERSATION> and <END_CONVERSATION> tags. The previous conversation turn is enclosed between <START_PREVIOUS_TURN> and <END_PREVIOUS_TURN> tags, while the current conversation turn is enclosed between <START_CURRENT_TURN> and <END_CURRENT_TURN> tags.\nThe previous conversation turn is provided for context; however, generate an annotation only for the current response. \nOnly use information present or inferable from the input. Avoid hallucinations or unjustified assumptions.\n\nTask description: Label one type of answer format that represents how the model responds in the current turn, from the list of options below.\nOptions: - Refusal to answer (with explanation): The system declines to respond and provides a reason or justification for the refusal.\n- Refusal to answer (without explanation): The system declines to respond without offering any reasoning for its refusal.\n- Partial refusal, expressing uncertainty, disclaiming: The system provides a partial response while indicating uncertainty or disclaiming full accuracy.\n- Direct Answer / Open Generation: The system provides a direct response or generates an open-ended output.\n- Continuation of Input: The system continues or builds upon the user's input rather than providing a discrete response.\n- Request for Information or Clarification: The system responds by asking the user for more details, clarifications, or specific information needed to address the request accurately.\n\n<START_CONVERSATION>\n\n<START_PREVIOUS_TURN>\nPrevious user prompt: None\nPrevious model response: None\n<END_PREVIOUS_TURN>\n\n<START_CURRENT_TURN>\nCurrent user prompt: как часто люди посещают интерактивные парки?\nCurrent model response: Частота посещения.\n<END_CURRENT_TURN>\n\n<END_CONVERSATION>\n\nReturn the answer as a JSON list of dictionaries, each with the fields 'labels' (exact label name(s) before ':' and after '- ') and 'confidence' (a score between 0 and 1).
