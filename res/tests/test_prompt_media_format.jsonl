Your task is to annotate conversation logs between users and AI chatbots. You will be given a specific task description, all possible label options for the task, and a part of the conversation, including the user prompt and model response from both previous and current turns. These might be pulled from any part of a multi-turn conversation. As a high-quality annotator you will diligently provide annotations on the current turn that are:\n1. Comprehensive: You will list all relevant annotations as the tasks can be multi-class (only one label is true) or multi-label (multiple categories can be true at once). Pay special attention to subtle, or implied properties of the input conversation. \n2. Precise: You must answer as a JSON list of dictionaries of exact labels name(s) and confidence (a score between 0 and 1) without any additional explanation, reasoning, or text.\n3. Calibrated: Reflect appropriate confidence in your annotation. If the input is ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations, acknowledge that explicitly.\nThe conversation log is enclosed between <START_CONVERSATION> and <END_CONVERSATION> tags. The previous conversation turn is enclosed between <START_PREVIOUS_TURN> and <END_PREVIOUS_TURN> tags, while the current conversation turn is enclosed between <START_CURRENT_TURN> and <END_CURRENT_TURN> tags.\nThe previous conversation turn is provided for context; however, generate an annotation only for the current prompt. \nOnly use information present or inferable from the input. Avoid hallucinations or unjustified assumptions.\n\nTask description: Label all types of media that are present in the current user prompt, from the list of options below.\nOptions: - Natural language: Text in regular written or spoken language used for communication.\n- Code: Programming scripts, snippets, or syntax in various programming languages, which can be any programming language such as Python, HTML etc.\n- Math/symbols: Mathematical expressions, formulas, or symbolic representations.\n- Formatted enumeration/itemization (bullets/lists): Structured lists of items or points presented with formatting like numbers, bullets, or letters.\n- Charts/Graphs: A visually rendered chart or graphic.\n- Images: Visual representations such as photographs, illustrations, that are not charts/graphs.\n- Audio: Sound files or other auditory content.\n- URLs: Web links that direct users to a specific online resource.\n- Likely retrieved/pasted content: Indicates that the text appears to be copied verbatim from an external source rather than originally composed; it may include quotes, large excerpts, error logs, or reference material paste such as snippets from an external text/code.\n- HTML\n- Other: Any other media type not covered by the above categories, such as 3D models, video, or mixed formats.\n\n<START_CONVERSATION>\n\n<START_PREVIOUS_TURN>\nPrevious user prompt: None\nPrevious model response: None\n<END_PREVIOUS_TURN>\n\n<START_CURRENT_TURN>\nCurrent user prompt: как часто люди посещают интерактивные парки?\nCurrent model response: Частота посещения.\n<END_CURRENT_TURN>\n\n<END_CONVERSATION>\n\nReturn the answer as a JSON list of dictionaries, each with the fields 'labels' (exact label name(s) before ':' and after '- ') and 'confidence' (a score between 0 and 1).
